WordPress
=========

This is a fork of the WordPress GitHub project (wordpress/wordpress).

This fork contains a composer.json file so that WordPress can be easily installed via Composer.

This project tracks versions by adding a patch versioning number onto WordPress versions.

For example,
* version 4.0 of WordPress would be version 4.0-pXX
* version 4.0.1 of WordPress would be version 4.0.1-pXX
